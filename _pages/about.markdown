Hi there, I am Maarten Peeters and I love programming. I started programming at the age of 15 using an old 8086 with DOS 3 dot something. At first using GW Basic and Quick Basic later on using Visual Basic 1. In my professional life I have been using Delphi, Visual Basic 6 and in the last decade C#.

In all those years that I've been programming I learned one important thing about myself: I'm trying to be crazy lazy! And this is a good thing! Because I will spend a lot of time reading about programming and building software to eliminate any repetitive work I run into. This is also something I've learned throughout the years, repetitive work isn't fun and the chance of introducing errors is vast.

When not busy working on awesome projects at a great company in the Netherlands, called <a href="https://www.qdelft.nl/">QDelft</a>, I can be found spending time with my wife and kid, playing with Technical Lego or figuring out programming stuff.
