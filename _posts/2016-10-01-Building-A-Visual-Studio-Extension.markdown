description: Some basic prerequisites for building a Visual Studio extension
---



## Introduction
In the next couple of months I will try to create some blog posts on this site about building Visual Studio Extensions for Visual Studio 2015.

So why would you create a Visual Studio extension? Well good question, I can only tell you why I would create an extension:

- To add features I'm missing (or simply cannot find)
- To automate anything that is repetitive
- Just because it can be done 

## Prerequisites

Here is a simple shopping list:

- Visual Studio 2015 with the ''Visual Studio Extensibility Tools''
... This SDK is available in all Visual Studio editions except Express and since Visual Studio 2015 it can only be installed during the installation of Visual Studio itself.
-

Already installed Visual Studio? Well you can alter it from the Apps & Features page in the Configuration Panel.
