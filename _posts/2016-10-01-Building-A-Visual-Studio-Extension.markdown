title: Building a Visual Studio Extension
---

## Introduction
In the next couple of months I will try to create some blog posts on this site about building Visual Studio Extensions for Visual Studio 2015.

So why would you create a Visual Studio extension? Well good question, I can only tell you why I would create an extension:
- To automate anything that is repetitive
- To add features I'm missing (or simply cannot find)
- Just because it can 

## Prerequisites

The only thing you will need is a Visual Studio 2015 environment, during the installation make sure to include the option ''Visual Studio Extensibility Tools Update 3''.
This SDK is available in all Visual Studio editions except Express.

Already installed Visual Studio? Well you can alter it from the Apps & Features page in the Configuration Panel.
